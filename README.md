About CNN:
Deep Learning is the branch of Machine Learning based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs, i.e., neural networks composed of more than 1 hidden layer).

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of the most popular DNN architectures (so CNNs are part of Deep Learning), but by no means the only one.

Other examples of deep nets include Autoencoders, Deep Belief Nets (DBN = a stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machines, RBM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and more. Note: even shallow RNNs can be considered part of Deep Learning since training them requires unrolling them through time, resulting in a deep net.
